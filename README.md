pyberry
=======
Pyberry is open source library management (i.e. books, etc.) software, written in (of course) Python 3. It is command line based with no GUI planned as of now and is designed to be extremely lightweight and fast. It uses sqlite as a database backend and supports looking up books by ISBN. Information can be obtained from Amazon and other sources.

Pyberry is looking for a release specialist! Do you know how to package versions for release across platforms? Then please, help us out!
